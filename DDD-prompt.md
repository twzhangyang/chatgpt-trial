#### You:
Please act as a domain expert on this domain and wait for a {domain} to be provided before you analyze {domain} by Domain-driven design(DDD)".
Let's define the steps of DDD, which have a total of 5 steps as follows:

"""
Step 1: Identify the subdomains: The first step is to identify the business problem domain and break it down into subdomains by business capabilities. I ask you don't miss any possible subdomains in this domain. Create a table with one column listing the subdomain name in the format of "Subdomain-{0}-{1}", where 0 is the number of the subdomain and 1 is the name of the subdomain. 
Step 2: Pick up one of the subdomains from Step 1 by order, remember it has an id in the form of "Subdomain-{0}-{1}", where 0 is the number of the subdomain and 1 is the name of the subdomain. 
Step 3: Business Capability analysis: Stick around the subdomain that was picked up in Step 2, and describe all actions that occur during this process of business capability in the form of "{who} {verb}", where the who is the user in the process and the verb is the behavior associated with the user. I ask you to list all the possible actions as much as possible, don't miss any actions that could happen in that subdomain.
Step 4: Define the ubiquitous language: Stick around the subdomain that was picked up in Step 2, and define a common language for this subdomain based on the business capabilities. These ubiquitous languages can be used by all team members, including business stakeholders and developers. 
Step 5: Go back to Step 2 and stop output until I ask you to continue and choose the unfinished subdomain. Repeat steps 2 to 4 until all subdomains are completed.

#### You:
The domain is one touch retail, please run Step 1 of the DDD

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, here is Step 1 of the DDD for One Touch Retail:

Step 1: Identify the subdomains

The first step in DDD is to identify the business problem domain and break it down into subdomains by business capabilities. In the case of One Touch Retail, we can identify the following subdomains:

Subdomain Id         | Subdomain Name                  
-------------------- | --------------------------------
Subdomain-1-auth     | Authentication                  
Subdomain-2-customer | Customer management             
Subdomain-3-product  | Product catalog management      
Subdomain-4-order    | Order management                
Subdomain-5-payment  | Payment processing              
Subdomain-6-shipment | Shipment and delivery management


Each subdomain is responsible for a specific set of capabilities within the One Touch Retail system. By breaking down the business problem domain into these subdomains, we can better understand the problem space and design a system that meets the needs of the business.

PUT         | /products/{sku}        | Update an existing product in the product catalog
DELETE      | /products/{sku}        | Delete a product from the product catalog        
POST        | /products/{sku}/images | Add an image for a product in the product catalog


These APIs are designed to provide access to the various features and functionalities of the product subdomain. They allow for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of products in the product catalog. In addition, they provide the ability to add images for products in the product catalog.

#### You:
Please act as a software developer to create diagrams for the Domain model and domain events by PlantUML from a plain text language, it has a total of 2 steps as follows:

"""
Diagram Step 1: Draw domain model: Stick around the subdomain that was picked up in Implementation Step 2, and create a PlantUML diagram for the domain model of the entities, and the value objects

Diagram Step 2: Draw domain events: Stick around the subdomain that was picked up in Implementation Step 3, and create a PlantUML diagram for the domain events.

#### ChatGPT:
Sure, here are the diagrams for the Domain model and Domain events for Subdomain-3-product in One Touch Retail using PlantUML:

Diagram Step 1: Draw domain model

```php
@startuml
!define ENTITY
!define TABLE(x) entity x << (T,tomato) >>
!define VALUE_OBJECT(x) class x << (VO,orange) >>
!define REPOSITORY(x) class x << (R,skyblue) >>
skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0

ENTITY Product {
  + SKU: string
  + name: string
  + description: string
  + price: decimal
}

VALUE_OBJECT ProductCategory {
  + name: string
}

VALUE_OBJECT ProductSKU {
  + value: string
}

ENTITY ProductImage {
  + id: int
  + url: string
}

REPOSITORY ProductRepository {
  + Create(product: Product)
  + Retrieve(sku: string): Product
  + Update(product: Product)
  + Delete(sku: string)
}

Product "1" -- "0..1" ProductCategory
Product "1" -- "1" ProductSKU
Product "0..*" -- "0..*" ProductImage
Product <|.down. ProductRepository

This diagram shows the domain model for Subdomain-3-product in One Touch Retail. The `Product` entity is the aggregate root that represents a physical or digital item offered for sale by One Touch Retail. The `ProductCategory` and `ProductSKU` are value objects that represent the grouping of similar products in the product catalog and a unique identifier assigned to a product, respectively. The `ProductImage` entity represents a visual representation of a product. The `ProductRepository` is a repository interface that defines the methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting products from the product catalog.

Diagram Step 2: Draw domain events

```less
@startuml
!define EVENT
skinparam backgroundColor #EEEBDC
!define CREATE_EVENT(x) entity "xCreatedEvent" << (E,green) >>
!define UPDATE_EVENT(x) entity "xUpdatedEvent" << (E,orange) >>
!define DELETE_EVENT(x) entity "xDeletedEvent" << (E,red) >>

CREATE_EVENT(Product)
UPDATE_EVENT(Product)
DELETE_EVENT(Product)

Product -> "1" "ProductCreatedEvent"
Product -> "1" "ProductUpdatedEvent"
Product -> "1" "ProductDeletedEvent"
@enduml
```

This diagram shows the domain events for Subdomain-3-product in One Touch Retail. The `ProductCreatedEvent`, `ProductUpdatedEvent`, and `ProductDeletedEvent` are triggered when a new product is created in the product catalog, when an existing product is updated, and when an existing product is deleted from the product catalog, respectively. These events are named based on the entity and the behavior associated with it in the past tense. The lines connecting the `Product` entity to the events indicate that the events are triggered by changes to the state of the `Product` entity.

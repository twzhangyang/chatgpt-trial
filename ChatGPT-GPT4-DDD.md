#### You:
Please act as a domain expert on this domain and wait for a {domain} to be provided before you analyze {domain} by Domain-driven design(DDD)".
Let's define the steps of DDD, which have a total of 5 steps as follows:

"""
Step 1: Identify the subdomains: The first step is to identify the business problem domain and break it down into subdomains by business capabilities. I ask you don't miss any possible subdomains in this domain. Create a table with one column listing the subdomain name in the format of "Subdomain-{0}-{1}", where 0 is the number of the subdomain and 1 is the name of the subdomain. 
Step 2: Pick up one of the subdomains from Step 1 by order, remember it has an id in the form of "Subdomain-{0}-{1}", where 0 is the number of the subdomain and 1 is the name of the subdomain. 
Step 3: Business Capability analysis: Stick around the subdomain that was picked up in Step 2, and describe all actions that occur during this process of business capability in the form of "{who} {verb}", where the who is the user in the process and the verb is the behavior associated with the user. I ask you to list all the possible actions as much as possible, don't miss any actions that could happen in that subdomain.
Step 4: Define the ubiquitous language: Stick around the subdomain that was picked up in Step 2, and define a common language for this subdomain based on the business capabilities. These ubiquitous languages can be used by all team members, including business stakeholders and developers. 
Step 5: Go back to Step 2 and stop output until I ask you to continue and choose the unfinished subdomain. Repeat steps 2 to 4 until all subdomains are completed.
"""
Note that when I say "Step {0}", it represents the implementation of the nth step, such as "Step 1" which represents the partition microservices for domain {domain} for Step 1: Identify the subdomains. when I say Subdomain-{0}-{1}, it represents the certain subdomain, such as "Subdomain-1-account" which represents subdomain with this id

#### ChatGPT:
Thank you for providing the steps for Domain-driven design (DDD). I am now waiting for the {domain} to be provided before I can proceed with the analysis.


#### You:
The domain is an online booking system for Australian budget airline company

#### ChatGPT:
Step 1: Identify the subdomains
Here's a table of the identified subdomains for the online booking system for an Australian budget airline company:

| Subdomain ID                | Subdomain Name     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Subdomain-1-Search          | Flight Search      |
| Subdomain-2-Booking         | Flight Booking     |
| Subdomain-3-Payment         | Payment Processing |
| Subdomain-4-Notification    | Notifications      |

| Subdomain-6-Checkin         | Online Check-in    |
| Subdomain-7-CustomerSupport | Customer Support   |

Now, we will proceed with Step 2 to Step 4 for each subdomain.

Step 2: Pick up one of the subdomains from Step 1 by order
We will start with Subdomain-1-Search (Flight Search).

Step 3: Business Capability analysis for Subdomain-1-Search

- Customer searches for flights
- Customer filters search results
- Customer sorts search results
- Customer views flight details

Step 4: Define the ubiquitous language for Subdomain-1-Search

- Origin: The starting location of the flight
- Destination: The end location of the flight
- Departure date: The date when the flight departs
- Return date: The date when the return flight departs (if applicable)
- One-way trip: A flight with no return
- Round-trip: A flight with a return
- Filters: Options to narrow down search results (e.g., price, duration, layovers)
- Sorting: Options to order search results (e.g., price, duration, departure time)

Step 5: Go back to Step 2

#### You:
Please act as a software developer to implement Domain-Driven design(DDD) based on your previous DDD analysis results, it has a total of 6 steps as follows:
"""
Implementation Step 1: Pick up one of the subdomains from Step 1 by order, remember it has an id in the form of "Subdomain-{0}-{1}", where 0 is the number of the subdomain and 1 is the name of the subdomain. 

Implementation Step 2: Domain modeling: Stick around the subdomain that was picked up in Implementation Step 1, model the entities, and identify the value objects in each subdomain. Entities are objects that represent the business concepts within each subdomain

Implementation Step 3: Define domain events: Stick around the subdomain that was picked up in Implementation Step 1, define domain events to communicate changes in the state within the system. Domain events are used to notify other parts of the system of changes in the state of an entity, allowing them to take action based on that change. Domain event in the form of "{0}{1}Event", where the 0 is the entity in the process and the 1 is the behavior with past tense associated with the entity. 

Implementation Step 4: API generation. Stick around the subdomain that was picked up in Implementation Step 1, generate corresponding RESTful APIs for this subdomain, and output these APIs in a table format.

Implementation Step 5: Go back to Implementation Step 1 and stop output until I ask you to continue and choose the unfinished subdomain. Repeat steps 2 to 4 until all subdomains are completed.

#### ChatGPT:
As a text-based AI, I cannot create PlantUML diagrams directly. However, I can provide you with the PlantUML code for the domain model and domain events. You can use PlantUML to generate the diagrams using this code.

For Subdomain-1-Search (Flight Search):

Diagram Step 1: Domain model

```plantuml
!pragma useVerticalIf on

class Flight {
  +origin: Airport
  +destination: Airport
  +departureDate: Date
  +departureTime: Time
  +duration: FlightDuration
  +price: Price
}

class Airport {
  +code: String
  +name: String
  +city: String
  +country: String
}

Flight "1" *-- "1" Airport : origin
Flight "1" *-- "1" Airport : destination
```

Diagram Step 2: Domain events

```plantuml
class FlightSearchedEvent {
  +flight: Flight
}

class SearchResultFilteredEvent {
  +filteredFlights: List<Flight>
}

class SearchResultSortedEvent {
  +sortedFlights: List<Flight>
}

class FlightDetailsViewedEvent {
  +flight: Flight
}
```

Please use the provided PlantUML code to generate the diagrams for the domain model and domain events for Subdomain-1-Search (Flight Search). You can continue with the same approach for the other subdomains.

Step 3: Business Capability Analysis for Subdomain-2-Payroll

The payroll subdomain of accounting involves all the tasks associated with paying employees for the work they've done during a specific period. Here are some of the key business capabilities and use cases associated with this subdomain:

1. **Employee Onboarding and Offboarding**: When new employees join the company or leave the company, the payroll system needs to be updated accordingly to add or remove them from the payroll.

2. **Time and Attendance Tracking**: This is the process of recording and managing employee work hours. It can involve clocking in and out, managing breaks, and accounting for different types of leave (e.g. vacation, sick, personal).

3. **Pay Calculation**: This involves determining the gross pay for each employee based on their hourly wage or salary, taking into account any overtime, bonuses, or deductions.

4. **Tax Deductions**: Payroll needs to calculate and deduct the correct amount of income tax from each employee's gross pay based on their tax bracket.

5. **Benefits and Deductions Management**: The payroll system should also manage other deductions from gross pay, such as contributions to retirement plans, health insurance premiums, and any other employee benefits.

6. **Pay Distribution**: This involves the actual disbursement of net pay to employees, whether through direct deposit, check, or other means.

7. **Record Keeping**: The company needs to maintain accurate records of all payroll transactions for auditing and tax purposes.

8. **Compliance**: Ensuring all payroll procedures are compliant with local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

9. **Reporting**: This involves the generation of payroll-related reports for internal use by management, as well as for regulatory reporting requirements.

#### You:
Please serve as a domain expert to model the "Subdomain-2-Payroll" and follow the steps below:
```
Step 1: Model the aggregate, entities, and identify the value objects in this subdomain and describe the attributes for these models.
An aggregate is a cluster of associated objects that are treated as a unit for the purpose of data changes, with external references restricted to one member of the aggregate, designated as the root. Entities represent domain objects primarily defined by their identity, while value objects describe characteristics or attributes but carry no concept of identity.

Step 2: Describe all the actions that occur within this subdomain in the format of "{entity}{verb}". Here, {entity} represents the entity that offers the behavior associated with this domain, and {verb} denotes the action of that behavior. Additionally, describe three business rules for each action.

Step 3: Define domain events to communicate changes in the state within the system and describe the attributes of these events. Domain events notify other parts of the system of changes in the state of an entity, allowing them to take action based on that change. Domain events should be named in the format "{0}{1}Event", where 0 is the entity in the process, and 1 is the behavior with past tense associated with the entity.
```

#### You:
I am employed with an accounting software company that specializes in providing small and medium business accounting solutions. We are planning to develop a web application for the "GeneralLedger" solution. I have created a domain model in markdown format, which includes Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects, and Domain Events. Please follow the below instructions to convert this domain model into C# code:

1. Create a corresponding C# class for each Aggregate and include the relevant entities and attributes as C# properties.
2. Model the attributes of each Entity as C# properties and the capabilities as C# methods.
3. Implement the business rules for each capability and raise exceptions if the validation fails.
4. Publish domain events within each capability.
5. Create Value Objects using C# records.
6. Create Domain Events using C# records.

```
## Aggregate: LedgerAccount
- ID: A unique identifier for the LedgerAccount.
- Accounts: A collection of Account entities associated with the LedgerAccount.
- Transactions: A collection of Transaction entities associated with the LedgerAccount.

## Entities:
### Account
- AccountCode: A unique identifier for the account.
- AccountType: The type of the account (assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, equity).
- Balance: The current balance of the account.
#### Capabilities
##### Create: This action involves creating a new account within the General Ledger.
- Business Rule: 
    - Business Rule 1: Unique Account Code
Each account within the General Ledger must have an account code with no empty GUID value.
    - Business Rule 2: Valid Account Type
The account type assigned during the creation of a new account must be a valid type as per the standard account classifications. These classifications might include assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and equity.
    - Business Rule 3: Initial Balance
When a new account is created, the initial balance of the account must be set to great or equal zero.
- Outcome: A new account is created in the General Ledger with a unique account code and an associated account type.
##### BalanceUpdate: This action involves updating the balance of an account in the General Ledger.
- Business Rule: The balance of an account should be updated after a transaction has been posted. The balance should always reflect the accurate state of the account.
    - Business Rule 1: Valid Transaction
Transaction Amount should great or equal to zero

    - Business Rule 2: Accurate Balance Calculation
The system should accurately calculate the new balance of an account after a transaction. This means appropriately adding or subtracting the transaction amount from the current balance, based on whether the transaction is a debit or a credit.
- Outcome: The balance of the relevant account is updated in the General Ledger.

### Transaction
- ID: A unique identifier for the transaction.
TransactionDetails: The details of the transaction (transaction type, date, debit amount, credit amount).
- AccountCode: The account code that the transaction is associated with.
#### Capabilities
##### Record: This action involves recording a new transaction in the General Ledger.
- Business Rules:
    - Business Rule 1: Transaction Integrity
Every transaction recorded in the General Ledger must have both a debit and a credit entry, maintaining the fundamental principle of double-entry accounting. This ensures that the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) stays balanced.

    - Business Rule 2: Valid Accounts
Each transaction must involve valid accounts in the General Ledger. Account code with no empty GUID value.

    - Business Rule 3: Accurate Transaction Amounts
The debit and credit amounts in a transaction must be equal. This is necessary to ensure the consistency and integrity of the accounting records. It's also important to verify that the transaction amount is a positive, non-zero number.
- Outcome: A new transaction is recorded in the General Ledger, associated with the relevant accounts.

### Value Objects:
#### AccountCode
- Code: A string representing the unique code of the account.

#### AccountType
- Type: A string representing the type of account (assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, equity).

#### TransactionDetail
- TransactionType: The type of the transaction (purchase, sale, payment, receipt).
- Date: The date of the transaction.
- DebitAmount: The debit amount of the transaction.
- CreditAmount: The credit amount of the transaction.

## Events:
### AccountCreatedEvent
- AccountCode: The account code of the newly created account.
- AccountType: The type of the newly created account.

### TransactionRecordedEvent
- TransactionID: The ID of the transaction that was recorded.
- AccountCode: The account code that the transaction was associated with.

### TransactionPostedEvent
- TransactionID: The ID of the transaction that was posted.
- PostDate: The date the transaction was posted.

### AccountBalanceUpdatedEvent
- AccountCode: The account code of the account whose balance was updated.
- NewBalance: The new balance of the account.

### FinancialReportGeneratedEvent
- ReportID: The ID of the generated report.
- GenerationDate: The date the report was generated.

Based on your markdown domain model, the corresponding C# classes could be implemented as follows:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Aggregate: LedgerAccount
public class LedgerAccount
{
    public Guid ID { get; set; }
    public ICollection<Account> Accounts { get; set; }
    public ICollection<Transaction> Transactions { get; set; }
}

// Value Objects
public record AccountCode(string Code);
public record AccountType(string Type);
public record TransactionDetail(string TransactionType, DateTime Date, decimal DebitAmount, decimal CreditAmount);

// Entities
public class Account
{
    public AccountCode AccountCode { get; set; }
    public AccountType AccountType { get; set; }
    public decimal Balance { get; set; }

    // Capabilities
    public void Create(AccountCode accountCode, AccountType accountType)
    {
        if (accountCode == null || string.IsNullOrEmpty(accountCode.Code))
            throw new Exception("Account Code must not be empty.");

        if (accountType == null || string.IsNullOrEmpty(accountType.Type))
            throw new Exception("Account Type must be valid.");

        Balance = 0;
        AccountCode = accountCode;
        AccountType = accountType;

        // Domain Event
        DomainEvents.Add(new AccountCreatedEvent(AccountCode, AccountType));
    }

    public void BalanceUpdate(decimal transactionAmount)
    {
        if (transactionAmount < 0)
            throw new Exception("Transaction Amount must be valid.");

        Balance += transactionAmount;

        // Domain Event
        DomainEvents.Add(new AccountBalanceUpdatedEvent(AccountCode, Balance));
    }
}

public class Transaction
{
    public Guid ID { get; set; }
    public TransactionDetail TransactionDetails { get; set; }
    public AccountCode AccountCode { get; set; }

    // Capabilities
    public void Record(TransactionDetail transactionDetail, AccountCode accountCode)
    {
        if (transactionDetail == null)
            throw new Exception("Transaction Detail must be valid.");

        if (accountCode == null || string.IsNullOrEmpty(accountCode.Code))
            throw new Exception("Account Code must be valid.");

        if (transactionDetail.DebitAmount <= 0 || transactionDetail.CreditAmount <= 0)
            throw new Exception("Transaction Amounts must be valid.");

        if (transactionDetail.DebitAmount != transactionDetail.CreditAmount)
            throw new Exception("Debit and Credit amounts must be equal.");

        TransactionDetails = transactionDetail;
        AccountCode = accountCode;

        // Domain Event
        DomainEvents.Add(new TransactionRecordedEvent(ID, AccountCode));
    }
}

// Domain Events
public record AccountCreatedEvent(AccountCode AccountCode, AccountType AccountType);
public record TransactionRecordedEvent(Guid TransactionID, AccountCode AccountCode);
public record TransactionPostedEvent(Guid TransactionID, DateTime PostDate);
public record AccountBalanceUpdatedEvent(AccountCode AccountCode, decimal NewBalance);
public record FinancialReportGeneratedEvent(Guid ReportID, DateTime GenerationDate);
```

Please note that it's essential to have the appropriate using directives at the top of your file, and also to ensure that `DomainEvents` (which I've used to store domain events) is correctly implemented in your domain model. The `DomainEvents` could be a list or other collection type that's part of a base class or interface implemented by your domain entities.

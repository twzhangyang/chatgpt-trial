Step 1: Relationship between tables and SQL description

In the provided SQL query, there are two tables involved: cust\_order and order\_line. The relationship between these two tables is established using an INNER JOIN on the order\_id column. This SQL query is designed to retrieve the daily summary of orders for each month, including the number of orders, the number of books, the total price, and the running total number of books.

Step 2: Infer table schema

Table 1: cust\_order

| Column      | Type |
| ----------- | ---- |
| order\_id   | INT  |
| order\_date | DATE |

Table 2: order\_line

| Column    | Type    |
| --------- | ------- |
| order\_id | INT     |
| book\_id  | INT     |
| price     | DECIMAL |

Step 3: Fake data and SQL execution

Table: cust\_order

| order\_id | order\_date |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 1         | 2023-03-01  |
| 2         | 2023-03-01  |
| 3         | 2023-03-02  |

Table: order\_line

| order\_id | book\_id | price |
| --------- | -------- | ----- |
| 1         | 101      | 10.00 |
| 1         | 102      | 20.00 |
| 2         | 101      | 10.00 |
| 3         | 102      | 20.00 |
| 3         | 103      | 30.00 |

SQL execution result:

| order\_month | order\_day | num\_orders | num\_books | total\_price | running\_total\_num\_books |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| 2023-03      | 2023-03-01 | 2           | 3          | 40.00        | 3                          |
| 2023-03      | 2023-03-02 | 1           | 2          | 50.00        | 5                          |

Step 4: Suggestions to optimize the SQL

1. Add an index on the cust\_order.order\_date column to speed up the DATE\_FORMAT function and GROUP BY operation.
2. Add an index on the cust\_order.order\_id and order\_line.order\_id columns to improve the performance of the INNER JOIN operation.
3. If the tables are large, consider partitioning the cust\_order table by order\_date to optimize query performance.

ORDER BY c.calendar_date ASC;

Step 1: Relationship between tables and SQL description

In the provided SQL query, there are three tables involved: calendar\_days, cust\_order, and order\_line. The relationship between the cust\_order and order\_line tables is established using an INNER JOIN on the order\_id column, while the calendar\_days and subquery (cust\_order and order\_line) are related through a LEFT JOIN on the calendar\_date and order\_day columns. This SQL query retrieves the daily summary of orders, including the number of orders, the number of books, the total price, the running total number of books, and the number of books sold seven days prior, for each calendar date.

Step 2: Infer table schema

Table 1: calendar\_days

| Column            | Type    |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| calendar\_date    | DATE    |
| calendar\_year    | INT     |
| calendar\_month   | INT     |
| calendar\_dayname | VARCHAR |

Table 2: cust\_order

| Column      | Type |
| ----------- | ---- |
| order\_id   | INT  |
| order\_date | DATE |

Table 3: order\_line

| Column    | Type    |
| --------- | ------- |
| order\_id | INT     |
| book\_id  | INT     |
| price     | DECIMAL |

Step 3: Fake data and SQL execution

Table: calendar\_days

| calendar\_date | calendar\_year | calendar\_month | calendar\_dayname |
| -------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| 2023-03-01     | 2023           | 3               | Wednesday         |
| 2023-03-02     | 2023           | 3               | Thursday          |

Table: cust\_order

| order\_id | order\_date |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 1         | 2023-03-01  |
| 2         | 2023-03-01  |
| 3         | 2023-03-02  |

Table: order\_line

| order\_id | book\_id | price |
| --------- | -------- | ----- |
| 1         | 101      | 10.00 |
| 1         | 102      | 20.00 |
| 2         | 101      | 10.00 |
| 3         | 102      | 20.00 |
| 3         | 103      | 30.00 |

SQL execution result:

| calendar\_date | calendar\_year | calendar\_month | calendar\_dayname | num\_orders | num\_books | total\_price | running\_total\_num\_books | prev\_books |
| -------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| 2023-03-01     | 2023           | 3               | Wednesday         | 2           | 3          | 40.00        | 3                          | NULL        |
| 2023-03-02     | 2023           | 3               | Thursday          | 1           | 2          | 50.00        | 5                          | NULL        |

Step 4: Suggestions to optimize the SQL

1. Add an index on the cust\_order.order\_date column to speed up the DATE\_FORMAT function and the JOIN operation.
2. Add an index on the calendar\_days.calendar\_date column to improve the performance of the LEFT JOIN operation.
3. Add an index on the cust\_order.order\_id and order\_line.order\_id columns to improve the performance of the INNER JOIN operation.
4. Consider partitioning the calendar\_days table by calendar\_year and calendar\_month to optimize query performance.
